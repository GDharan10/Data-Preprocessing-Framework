# Framework for Data Preprocessing

This Jupyter Notebook provides a structured framework for data preprocessing, including data loading, cleaning, preprocessing, machine learning model training, and deployment. It outlines the main steps involved in the data analysis and machine learning pipeline.

## Installation and Libraries

Make sure you have the following packages installed:

- `dataprep`
- `pymongo`
- `lazypredict`

You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install dataprep pymongo lazypredict

```

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score, accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, roc_curve, roc_auc_score
from lazypredict.Supervised import LazyRegressor, LazyClassifier
import pickle
import pymongo
import lazypredict

## Connections
Establish connections to external data sources such as Google Drive and MongoDB as required for your project.

## Loading and Preparing Data
Load datasets from different sources such as local files, Google Drive, or MongoDB. Perform data cleaning steps including handling missing values, duplicates, incorrect formats, and unstructured data.

## Data Preprocessing
Preprocess the data by handling outliers, skewness, feature scaling, and dimensionality reduction using techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## Machine Learning
### Supervised Learning (Regression/Classification)
1. Ensure data availability and separate independent and dependent variables.
2. Identify suitable algorithms/models for your task.
3. Train models and evaluate their performance using appropriate metrics.

### Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)
1. Choose the number of clusters using methods such as the Elbow method or Silhouette method.
2. Train clustering models and predict clusters.
3. Visualize clusters for analysis.

## Additional Tasks
Perform additional exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature importance analysis, sentiment analysis, or recommendation system tasks as required for your project.

## Model Deployment
Save trained models using Pickle for future deployment.
